Hi Tomasz  Thanks for the time you spent with me in the interview. 
 I discussed your application with my supervisor, 
 and we think that the following home assignment may help us decide how to go forward.
   --- 8< ------  Given a JSON file such as: 
    { "foo": ["bar", "baz"], "orange": ["banana", "mango"], "bar": ["qux", "quux"], "monkey": ["cow", "parrot"], "banana": ["mango", "monkey"], "baz": ["baz"], "quux": ["bar", "banana"], "cow": ["orange"], ... } 
     Write a Python program using only the standard libraries that finds all the cycles in such a file: 
    In the example above we can have the cycle: "bar" -> "quux" -> "bar"  
    Make sure that:  - Every cycle is represented only once, e.g. 
    `"bar" -> "quux" -> "bar"` is the same cycle as `"quux" -> "bar" -> "quux"`. 
    - Only minimal cycles should be shown, e.g. in `"foo" -> "bar" -> "quux" -> "bar"`,
     the `"foo"â€‹ ->` should not be part of the cycle.  
     Please deliver your solution as a link to a Git repository or a tarball of that repository. 
     Try to commit often. 
     Use of packages from pypi for development time dependencies, e.g. auto-formatting,
    testing, mocking etc, is allowed.  ------ >8 --- 
    Feel free to contact me with any questions.  Looking forward to your solution.
    Thanks in advance for your reply!
